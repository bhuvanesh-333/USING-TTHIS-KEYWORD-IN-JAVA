Java Try-Catch-Finally Example
This project contains a simple Java program illustrating how the try, catch, and finally blocks work together in exception handling.

Code Description
The code initializes an integer variable a with value 10.

The try block executes code that may throw an exception.

If an exception occurs, the catch block catches it and prints the exception.

The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It prints "i am the final boss" as a final statement.
